A monitoring server (node01) has newly been introduced in your environment. We need to update the agents.conf file with a list of servers in the environment and their details.



Navigate to the /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server directory. The list of servers is given in the inventory file under group lamp_app. 
This information must be used to generate an agents.conf file at /etc/agents.conf location on the monitoring_server i.e node01.


Update the generate-agent-info.yml playbook. Use the given template file /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server/templates/agents.conf.j2. 
Moreover, a sample output file name /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server/templates/agents.conf.j2 is also given for your reference. T
he target servers are not up yet, so don't try to connect to them. Just use their details given in the inventory file.

Edit the agents.conf.j2 template:


vi /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server/templates/agents.conf.j2



Update it as below:


hostname, ipaddress, monitor_port, type, protocol
{% for host in groups['lamp_app'] %}
{{ host }}, {{ hostvars[host]['ansible_host'] }}, {{ hostvars[host]['monitor_port'] }}, {{ hostvars[host]['protocol'] }}
{% endfor %}



Edit the generate-agent-info.yml playbook.


vi /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server/generate-agent-info.yml



Update it as below:


---
- hosts: monitoring_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - template:
        src: agents.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/agents.conf



Execute the playbook:


cd /home/bob/playbooks/monitoring-server/
ansible-playbook -i inventory generate-agent-info.yml
